##Notes

### Service - 
### Service takes in a string and appends it to the base URL, then returns the promise and on success call as the callAPI service again to retrieve the movies.  I wanted to have random charactors so I creating a random number and calling the appi for each charactor.  I know this can costly but for a better user experience (so you dont have the same charactors) I added an element of randomness.

### Cards - 
### After retriving the flat data, I place the data in an array of double indexed arrays so i can  ng-repeat throught array and place both elements in a two column card.

### Graph - 
### I used D3 charts for the bar chart. 


### NOTES  -
###It mentioned in the directions there was a reference to the "image to see how the card will look but I didnt get the image so i put placeholders in there.
