## Angular Starter with Webpack and Typescript

#### To get started, clone the repo and run `npm install`.

#### If you want to use Webpack-Dev-Server instead of live-server/http-server/etc:
- `npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server`
- Add this to the scripts object of `package.json`: `"start": "webpack && node node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server"`
